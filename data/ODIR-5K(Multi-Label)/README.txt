Ocular Disease Intelligent Recognition (ODIR) is a structured ophthalmic database of 5,000 patients with age, color fundus photographs from left and right eyes and doctors' diagnostic keywords from doctors.

This dataset is meant to represent ‘‘real-life’’ set of patient information collected by Shanggong Medical Technology Co., Ltd. from different hospitals/medical centers in China. In these institutions, fundus images are captured by various cameras in the market, such as Canon, Zeiss and Kowa, resulting into varied image resolutions.
Annotations were labeled by trained human readers with quality control management. They classify patient into eight labels including:

Normal (N),
Diabetes (D),
Glaucoma (G),
Cataract (C),
AMD (A),
Hypertension (H),
Myopia (M),
Other diseases/abnormalities (O)
