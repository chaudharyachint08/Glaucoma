Special Explanation on ODIR-5K Database and Annotations

1. The annotated classification labels are determined by the following rules
   (1) The classification labels of one patient depends on left and right fundus images and corresponding diagnosis keywords;
   (2) One patient is classified as normal if and only if both left and right diagnosis keywords are "normal fundus";	 
   (3) The classification labels are decided by the other fundus image when one of fundus images is marked as "normal fundus";
   (4) Treat all suspected diseases or abnormalities as diagnosed diseases or abnormalities. 

2. Special words that appeared in diagnostic keywords	
    (1) The appearance of the two keywords "anterior segment image" and "no fundus image" are not classified into any of the eight categories in this competition.
       For example, there are two anterior segment images in ODIR-5K database, 1706_left.jpg and 1710_right.jpg. 
	In this case, the patient's classification labels are only judged by the other fundus image of the same patient.
	In addition, it is very important to note that the diagnostic keyword for 4580_left.jpg image is "no fundus image".
	Because this image is actually not the left fundus image of this patient, it is from a rotation of right fundus image.
	The introduction of these two diagnostic keywords can also be one of the challenges in this competition. 
   (2) The keywords "lens dust", "optic disk photographically invisible", "low image quality" and "image offset" do not play a decisive role in determining patient's labels.

3. The background of the following images is quite different from the rest ones. They are fundus images uploaded from the hospital. 
	   We are sure that these images are preprocessed. You can decide by yourself whether or not to train these images in the model.
